# Parallel Processor Architecture & Algorithms

- Processor Architecture
  - Computer architecture has evolved
    - Intel 8086 (1981): 5 MHz (used in first IBM PC)
    - Intel 80486 (1989): 25 MHz (became i486 because of a court ruling that prohibits the trademarking of numbers)
    - Pentium (1993): 66 MHz
    - Pentium 4 (2000): 1.5 GHz (deep â‰ˆ 30-stage pipeline)
    - Pentium D (2005): 3.2 GHz (and then the clock speed stopped increasing)
    - Quadcore Xeon (2008): 3 GHz (increasing number of cores on chip is key to performance scaling)
